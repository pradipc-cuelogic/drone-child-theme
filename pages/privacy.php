					    	<p class="text-size-md text-secondary-color"><strong>Acend respects the privacy of our customers and other users of our websites, products and services.</strong></p>
					    	<p>When we refer hereinafter to “we”, “our”, “us” or “Acend”, we mean Acend Inc., its subsidiaries including Acend Insurance Solutions, LLC, and domain names we use including DroneInsurance.com. When we refer hereinafter to “you” or “your”, we mean you or the person visiting our websites and/or using our products and services. Our “Services” mean (a) products and services we sell online, (b) website information or tools we provide on Acend.io, DroneInsurance.com or our affiliated websites (collectively, our “Sites”), and (c) any applications we develop for the web, Android and iOS.</p>
					    	<p>This Privacy Policy explains how we collect personal information of users of our Sites and/or our Services (individually, a “User” and collectively, “Users”), how we handle and protect that information, and what Users can do to help protect that information. We are committed to safeguarding personal information.</p>
					    	<p>Please note that we may change this Privacy Policy from time to time to accurately reflect how we then gather and manage User information. All changes to this Privacy Policy are effective upon posting to our Sites without prior notice.</p>
							<p><strong>Please read this Privacy Policy for full details. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, then we cannot provide our Services to you, and you should stop accessing our Services and deactivate any account with us which you have created.</strong></p>
							<p><strong>By using our Services, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of our Services after we post any modifications to the Privacy Policy will constitute your acknowledgment of the modifications and your consent to abide and be bound by the modified Privacy Policy.</strong></p>

					    	<h2 class="primary-title text-primary-color animateIn">Collection of Information</h2>
					    	<p>In the normal course of operating our Sites and providing our Services, we may collect, store and process personal information that you make available to us when accessing or using our Services. This personally identifiable information may include a User’s name, e-mail address, street or mailing address and mobile phone number (“Personal Information”). In particular, Personal Information may include:</p>
					    	<ul class="comman-list list-inside">
								<li>Registration and Account Information: When you register with us, create an account and access our Services, or thereafter update your information on your account, you are voluntarily providing us with Personal Information. Personal Information may include your name, email address, account password and other relevant information.</li>
								<li>Account Management: Following registration, you or your authorized administrator may add, delete or modify information on your account, including information concerning pilots and drones for example. Pilot information may include a pilot’s name, date of birth, certificates and FAA licenses. Drone information may include details such as the drone’s model number, tail number and serial number.</li>
								<li>Access or Use Our Services: When you access our Services, Personal Information that you provide to secure insurance or to pay insurance premiums is provided to us voluntarily.</li>
								<li>Communications with Us: You may voluntarily make Personal Information available to us when you contact our customer service agents, and/or when you report, change or update an insurance claim. You may also voluntarily provide us with Personal Information so we can respond to your requests for information, manage the application process, and/or send you communications.</li>
								<li>Social Media Services: When you sign in, or engage, with our Services through Social Media Websites, you are agreeing to give us on-going access to your Personal Information that you have provided to such third-party accounts, including your public profile, birthday, work history, education history, personal interests and other personal information. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third-party accounts that are linked from our Services.</li>
								<li>Survey Information: From time to time, you may complete surveys relating to your experiences with our Services, and may in turn provide to us your demographic information (e.g., city, state, account ID and date of birth) and other Personal Information.</li>
								<li>Information from Other Sources or Combined by Us: We may combine information from outside sources to customize your experience using our Services.</li>
								<li>Use of Certain Third-Party Services. We use certain third-party services to capture and aggregate User data as well as to communicate with our Users. We also use third-party analytic services to help us better understand usage of our Services. In particular, we provide a limited amount of User information (such as a User’s email address and sign-up date) to such third-party services and utilize such services to collect data for analysis when Users visit our Sites or use our Services so that we may better improve our Services.</li>
								<li>Log Data: We may also receive, store and process “log data”, which is information that is automatically recorded whenever you access or use our Services, regardless of whether you are registered with us or logged into your account, such as your IP address, the date and time you accessed our Sites, the hardware and software you are using, referring and exit pages and URLs, the number of clicks, device event information, pages viewed and the order of those pages, and the amount of time spent on particular pages.</li>
								<li>Unmanned Aircraft System Log Files: We may receive, store and process log files from your unmanned aircraft system. We may also transmit these log files to our insurance carriers or their representatives as part of the claims process.</li>
								<li>Photos: We may receive and store photos that you upload to our Sites as part of the claims process. We may also transmit these photos to our insurance carriers or their representatives as part of the claims process.</li>
								<li>Telephone Communication: When you call our customer service team, we may collect your name, account ID and other information to assist you in addition to any Personal Information that you may provide in the process of obtaining or learning about our Services.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>We may also obtain other Personal Information about you as necessary from consumer reporting agencies, insurers and unaffiliated third parties, public records and other sources. Information collected about you may include information related to your employment history, credit score, credit history, or transactions with us or others. Also, we may check the information you provide to us with certain government databases, including the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), regarding your application to use our Services.</p>
							<p>We use your Personal Information to provide market-leading services to you, to confirm that the information we know about you is accurate and complete, to report claims, to prevent fraud, to conduct analyses for our business, for other normal business administration and related services, and as otherwise required or permitted by applicable law. In addition, our Sites automatically collect anonymous information about Users. For example, our Sites automatically gather a User’s Internet Protocol address, which Internet Service Provider the User utilizes, statistics about how Users navigate through and use our Sites, and information gathered through the use of “cookies.” A “cookie” is a piece of data stored on the User’s computer tied to information about the User.</p>
							<p>We use cookies and the other anonymous information to maintain the quality of our Services, help us better understand how Users choose our Sites, and to know when Users have accessed our Sites from a paid advertiser, an affiliate website, or a strategic partner website. We also compile statistics that track the usage of our Sites. These statistics are used for internal purposes only and contain no Personal Information.</p>
							<p>Solely for the purposes of confirming valid traffic from certain pay-per-click search engines, IP addresses for such Users are monitored, and may be compared to the records of that search engine.</p>
							<p>Certain Internet browsers such as Explorer, Firefox and Safari offer a “do not track” or “DNT” feature that sends a signal to websites visited by the user indicating the user does not wish to be tracked. We do not currently respond to browsers’ DNT signals with respect to our Sites, in part, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent. We will continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a common standard.</p>

					    	<h2 class="primary-title text-primary-color animateIn">How We Protect and Use Personal Information</h2>
					    	<p>We work to protect the security of Personal Information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the information that is transmitted on our Sites. We may employ companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples may include providing marketing assistance, performing statistical analysis, and providing customer service. These companies and individuals will have access to the Personal Information only as necessary to perform their functions, and may not access or use it for any other purpose.</p>
					    	<p>We have commercially appropriate security measures in place within our database and physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information that has been collected on the Sites. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and we are unable to guarantee the absolute security of the Personal Information we have collected from you.</p>
					    	<p>Your password and account credentials are sensitive. We need to be able to assume that anyone using your account as you, by using your password and credentials, is you. We will not ask you for your password. Please do not share your password or account credentials with anyone. By creating your Acend Account, you agree that the information you share with us is complete and accurate, and that you will keep your information up-to-date.</p>
					    	<p>We may utilize e-mail to communicate with Users regarding our Services. We may also occasionally use a User’s Personal Information to notify the User of our Services and special offers via periodic mailings or e-mail updates. Users may opt-out of these communications by emailing us at Info@droneinsurance.com with “UNSUBSCRIBE” in the subject line.</p>
					    	<p>We will not sell Personal Information of any User. However, in the event we go through a business transition, such as a merger or an acquisition of our equity interests or assets, the Personal Information of our Users will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.</p>
					    	<p>If your information is accessed by unauthorized entities, we will seek to notify you in compliance with applicable law.</p>

					    <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane animateIn" id="third-party-websites">
					    	<h2 class="primary-title text-primary-color animateIn">Third Party Websites</h2>
					    	<p>We may maintain links to other websites on our Sites, including social media sites. If a User chooses to visit other websites from our Sites, we will not be responsible for the privacy practices or content of those other websites. Please refer to such third party’s privacy policy to find out more about such party’s data practices.</p>
					    	<p>We use industry leading secure third-party payment processing services for all credit card transactions. Privacy policies and security policies for these third-party services are available on their respective sites. To maximize security, we will not keep any record of your actual credit card or debit card.</p>

						<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane animateIn" id="user-postings">
					    	<h2 class="primary-title text-primary-color animateIn">User Postings</h2>
					    	<p>Except as otherwise expressly described in this Privacy Policy, this policy only addresses the use and disclosure of Personal Information and other information we collect from you. In the course of your use of our Sites, you may elect to post or otherwise disclose information about yourself on certain features that we may make available to Users now or in the future that enable Users to communicate with the public at large or with a group, or on social media sites that are linked to the Sites. Whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected or used by others. Such postings may also appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting. Such activities are beyond the control of Acend and this Privacy Policy. You should therefore exercise discretion when disclosing any Personal Information or other information when using such features.</p>

					    <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane animateIn" id="children-online-privacy">
					    	<h2 class="primary-title text-primary-color animateIn">Children’s Online Privacy</h2>
					    	<p>Our Services are not directed toward children. The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”) imposes restrictions on commercial websites, including ours. It is our policy to be compliant with the requirements of COPPA and not to solicit or collect personally identifiable information from children under age 13 (“Child”) without parent or guardian consent. If you are a parent or guardian and you learn that your Child has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us. If we discover that a Child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our servers.</p>

						 <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane animateIn" id="disclosure-comply-low">
					    	<h2 class="primary-title text-primary-color animateIn">Disclosure to Comply with Law</h2>
					    	<p>Although we make every effort to preserve User privacy, we may need to disclose or provide access to Personal Information if required to do so by law or if we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with the law, such as in connection with a judicial proceeding, court order or legal process, including (a) to respond to claims asserted against us; (b) to comply with legal process (e.g., subpoenas and warrants); (c) to enforce and administer our agreements with Users; (d) to prevent or investigate fraud; or (e) to protect our rights or the safety of us, our Users or members of the public.</p>
					    	<p>We will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Users about law enforcement requests for their data unless: (a) providing notice is prohibited by the legal process itself, by court order we receive, or by applicable law; or (b) we believe that providing notice would (i) be futile, (ii) be ineffective, or (iii) would create a risk of injury or bodily harm to an individual or group, or (iv) create or increase a risk of fraud upon us, our Users or otherwise through our Services.</p>
